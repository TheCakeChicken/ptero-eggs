# SCP: Secret Laboratory
### Get the game [here](https://store.steampowered.com/app/700330/SCP_Secret_Laboratory/) from Steam

This egg is built to use SCP:SL Dedicated Server, due to compatibility issues with ServerMod due to recent updates.
The egg will be updated again once ServerMod is compatible.

#### The account details given during server setup MUST have Steam Guard disabled and have [this](https://steamdb.info/app/996560/) in the library, to prevent SteamCMD issues. It is not recommended to use your main account for this.

### Server Port
The server will run on port 7777 by default.

## FOR SERVERMOD -- NOT COMPATIBLE RIGHT NOW.
### Install notes
After server creation, if using MultiAdmin, create a folder inside the servers folder for your configuration.

#### Plugins can be added to the server using ServerMod. A list of available plugins is available from their [Discord](https://discord.gg/8nvmMTr)
