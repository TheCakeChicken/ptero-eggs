# SCP: Secret Laboratory
### Get the game [here](https://store.steampowered.com/app/700330/SCP_Secret_Laboratory/) from Steam

This egg is built to run using [MultiAdmin](https://github.com/Grover-c13/MultiAdmin) & [ServerMod](https://github.com/Grover-c13/Smod2/).
However, you can still run this server using the default LocalAdmin.exe by modifying the Startup File variable.

### Install notes
When setting up the server, you should provide Steam credentials for an account which has SCP:SL in it's library, otherwise the install may fail.

After server creation, if using MultiAdmin, create a folder inside the servers folder for your configuration.

### Server Port
The server will run on port 7777 by default.

#### Plugins can be added to the server using ServerMod. A list of available plugins is available from their [Discord] (https://discord.gg/8nvmMTr)
